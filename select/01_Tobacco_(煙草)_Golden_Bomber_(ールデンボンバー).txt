You know, because I don't forget,
Because I don't throw everything away
The smiles, words you gave me, and pain too
Like bruises that won't disappear
Saying clearly, I still love you

I guess it won't turn over anymore
Is that guy better?
What does he have that I don't have?
I have no idea at all

Wriggling struggling suffering
Your extremely straight voice from our last phone talk
Aah, I can't get it out of my head

You know, because I don't forget,
Because I don't throw everything away
The smiles, words you gave me, and pain too
Like bruises that won't disappear
Saying clearly, please let me still love you

I won't be able to love anyone anymore, I thought through this year
I have fallen with you so much that it was wearing me out like this
Aah I'm losing love

You know, I don't forget but don't think that's it's a heavy feeling
I won't bother you
So please let me secretly picture you
So many melodies overflow me

I searched and searched and found
I just loved everything about you
And the cigarette I smoke copying you
Is really not tasty at all
But I just want to understand you

You know, because I don't forget,
Because I don't throw everything away
I really want to send you mail or call but
Become happy, okay? With someone else
Tears flow down so hard that I hate it

Farewell, I love you but
It doesn't reach you, doesn't reach, doesn't reach, doesn't reach
